Podcast:: [Dan Carlin's Hardcore History](/not_created.md), `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_podcasts}`   
Episode:: Show 68 - BLITZ Human Resources   
Link:: [http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-67-Supernova-in-the-East-vi](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-67-Supernova-in-the-East-vi)   
Description:: The Atlantic Slave Trade mixes centuries of human bondage with violence, economics, commerce, geo-political competition, liberty, morality, injustice, revolution, tragedy and bloody reckonings. That sounds like a lot, yet this show merely scratches the surface of this enormous subject.   
Topics:: [History](/not_created.md)
