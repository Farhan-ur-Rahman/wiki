**#KUBERNETES**   
     
   
**Kubernetes**, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containrized applications.   
   
Its a open source container management tool to increase or decrease the container   
   
 which automates deployment, Container Scaling & Load Balancing    
   
strategy for maximizing availability and scalability, is **the process of distributing network traffic efficiently among multiple backend services**   
   
   
Secondly, had an overview of what is kubernetes clusters   
   
What is a Kubernetes cluster? A Kubernetes cluster is **a set of nodes that run containerized applications**. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines.   
   
     
   
**While Docker is a container runtime, Kubernetes is a platform for running and managing containers from many container runtimes**.   
   
     
   
     
   
     
   
     
   
     
   
     
   
LOAD BALANCING     
   
A load balancer is a device that distributes networks or application traffic across a cluster of servers.   
   
     
   
across different backend servers

LOAD BALANCER TYPES   
   
     
   
L4 AND L7   
   
     
   
L4 inspects the packet upto layer of 4 of the networking stack TCP/UDP   
   
     
   
L7 Application load balancer   
   
     
   
inspects the packets all the way upto layer 7 of networking stack HTTP/HTTPS   
   
     
   
     
   
     
   
     
   
     
   
     
   
create clusters of containers   
   
     
   
It schedules , runs and manages isolated containers which are running on virtual/physical/cloud machines   
   
     
   
all top cloud providers support to kubernetes    
   
google cloud    
   
AWS   
   
microsoft azure   
   
     
   
group of nodes or containers known as containers   
   
     
   
Master control the nodes   
   
     
   
by API stands for **Application Programming Interface between master and node**   
   
     
   
     
   
What problems does Kubernetes solve ?   
   
     
   
     
   
What are the tasks of an orchestration tool ?   
   
     
   
     
   
Firstly, I have downloaded the docker and connect it to my terminal and in the terminal i have started docker I have pulled the jenkins and installed it Using docker pull jenkins/jenkins command   
   
     
   
have logged into the jenkins through LOCALHOST:8080 paste the password that has been provided by jenkins
