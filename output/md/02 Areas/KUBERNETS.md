**#KUBERNETES**   
     
   
**Kubernetes**, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerised applications.   
   
Its a open source container management tool to increase or decrease the container   
which automates deployment, Container Scaling & Load Balancing    
   
strategy for maximising availability and scalability, is **the process of distributing network traffic efficiently among multiple backend services**   
   
   
What is a Kubernetes cluster?   
A Kubernetes cluster is **a set of nodes that run containerised applications**. Containerising applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines.   
   
     
   
**While Docker is a container runtime, Kubernetes is a platform for running and managing containers from many container runtimes**.   
   
LOAD BALANCING     
   
A load balancer is a device that distributes networks or application traffic across a cluster of servers.   
across different backend servers   
   
   
LOAD BALANCER TYPES-   
   
   
-L4 AND L7   
-L4 inspects the packet upto layer of 4 of the networking stack TCP/UDP   
-L7 Application load balancer   
-Inspects the packets all the way upto layer 7 of networking stack HTTP/HTTPS   
   
   
create clusters of containers   
   
It schedules , runs and manages isolated containers which are running on virtual/physical/cloud machines   
   
All top cloud providers support to Kubernetes-   
   
Google cloud    
AWS   
Microsoft azure   
   
What problems does Kubernetes solve ?   
The core problem that Kubernetes is solving is the ability to manage containerised apps at scale.   
   
**Kubernetes orchestrates Pods for us by:**   
   
-   Scheduling the Pods to run on certain nodes.   
-   Auto-scaling up or down, horizontally or vertically, the Pods for us.   
-   Allowing the same application to run in multiple Pods with replicas.
