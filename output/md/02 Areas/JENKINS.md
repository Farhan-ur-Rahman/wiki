**#JENKINS**   
   
   
   
-   Jenkins allows you to continuously deliver your software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.   
-   We can build, test, deploy and take a backup of the code with one single job which makes the product deployment easier and perfect results.   
-   Automation, including CI/CD and test automation is one of the key practices that allow DevOps teams to deliver “faster, better, cheaper” technology solutions.   
   
Jenkins plugin-   
   
plugins are the small libraries that add new abilities to Jenkins and can provide integration points to other tools   
   
CI-   
   
Continuous Integration, in its simplest form, involves a tool that monitors your version control system for changes. Whenever a change is detected, this tool automatically compiles and tests your application. If something goes wrong, the tool immediately notifies the developers so that they can fix the issue immediately.   
It is designed to help identify and fix integration and regression issues faster   
   
CD-   
   
Integration and acceptance tests is now such that teams can apply the automated deployment techniques developed in the previous phase to push out new changes directly into production.
