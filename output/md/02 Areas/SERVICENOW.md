**#ServiceNow**    
   
Personally experienced the ServiceNow Ticketing tool with the instance ID and used it as a Administrator User.   
   
Looked out the interface of the ticketing system that is ServiceNow.   
   
learned to raise a manual ticket by filling the ticket number and the issues facing in the ticket should be filled in the description box.   
   
There is also a priority box that shows if the issue is low or high   
   
Learned to add  users and groups and roles and how to manage them.   
   
   
If the issue is been resolved then it should be put to resolved if not then it should be assigned to the partner, After confirming with them the ticket should be set to (in process) and then submit the ticket.

**Later, I practised utilising clint scripting to auto-populate fields after going through the revision of servicenow. Using JavaScript**    
   
     
   
     
   
Later,I have gone through servicenow training utilising the HTML fields provided by the serviceNow, I worked on providing a notification for any record inserts or updates.   
   
     
   
When something is completed or changed in ServiceNow, an EVENT-based notification is sent out.   
   
     
   
I have started my day with previous topics of ServiceNow as a revision in that we have practically practiced how to import sets and transform map them manually or automatically , After that we have gone through the email notifications scripting and business rules   
   
     
   
from email scripting we can pass some syntax so that the email should be sent accordingly.
