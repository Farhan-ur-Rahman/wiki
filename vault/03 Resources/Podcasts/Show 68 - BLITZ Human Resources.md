Podcast:: [[Dan Carlin's Hardcore History]], #podcasts
Episode:: Show 68 - BLITZ Human Resources
Link:: http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-67-Supernova-in-the-East-vi
Description:: The Atlantic Slave Trade mixes centuries of human bondage with violence, economics, commerce, geo-political competition, liberty, morality, injustice, revolution, tragedy and bloody reckonings. That sounds like a lot, yet this show merely scratches the surface of this enormous subject.
Topics:: [[History]]
